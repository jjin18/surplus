"""
civic_geo.py : the stack of governments standing over one point.

Every address in the United States sits inside seven or eight separate
governments at once, each with its own election, its own money and its own
powers. Residents experience them as one blur -- "the city", "the government"
-- which is exactly why nobody knows that the body raising their water rate is
elected in an off-cycle race nobody covers.

This module names the stack for a point, and says what each layer actually
decides. The map uses it as a lens: pick a layer, see the boundary you are
inside, and ask that layer's question in that layer's vocabulary.

Two keyless sources:

  * the US Census Geocoder, which answers "which congressional district,
    state legislative districts, county, place and school districts contain
    this point" in one call, and
  * OpenStreetMap's is_in, which adds the council district (a `political`
    boundary the Census does not carry) and how the land at that point is
    actually used -- plus the relation ids the map needs to draw an outline.

What is deliberately NOT here: the legal zoning code. OpenStreetMap knows how
land is used, not what an ordinance permits, and pretending otherwise would be
the same unsourced confidence the rest of this surface refuses. The layer names
the authority and the question asks it for the code.
