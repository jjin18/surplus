"""
agents/exa.py — Exa-backed prospect discovery.

Same contract as `llm.discover_candidates(source, icp)` — returns a list of
candidate dicts in the per-source shape — but uses Exa's semantic search
instead of Claude + web_search. Cheaper, faster, and Exa's index has good
LinkedIn / GitHub / X coverage so we can extract the canonical profile URL
straight from the result without an extra parsing step.

Gated by EXA_API_KEY. When unset, callers fall back to llm.discover_candidates
(Claude) and ultimately the mock pool.

Result shapes per source — matching what the existing SourceAdapter expects:

  linkedin: {identity, name, linkedin_url, role?, company?, contact_resolved: True}
  github  : {identity, name, github_url, gh_stars: 0}
  x       : {identity, name, x_url, x_followers: 0}

The 0s for gh_stars / x_followers are because Exa's index returns metadata
about the page, not live API data. The scorer accepts 0 gracefully — the
prospect just won't get the signal bonus.

# ---- city normalization --------------------------------------------------
#
# LinkedIn locations are written many different ways for the same place
# ("San Francisco", "San Francisco Bay Area", "SF", "Bay Area", "Oakland").
# Three things rely on this:
#
#   (1) Query phrasing  — we want "in the san francisco bay area" because
#       that's literally what LinkedIn profile pages say.
#   (2) includeText     — Exa's server-side hard filter (1 phrase, ≤5 words).
#       Pick the *shortest substring that appears in every alias* so we
#       don't over-prune. "San Francisco" matches "San Francisco" AND
#       "San Francisco Bay Area"; "San Francisco Bay Area" would miss the
#       former.
#   (3) Post-filter     — broader set of aliases scanned against the
#       returned snippet text so we drop NYC profiles that snuck through
#       ranking even after includeText.
#
# Entries are keyed by the lowercase form of what the user typed on intake.
# `canonical_phrase` goes into the query, `include_text` into the Exa filter,
# `aliases` into the post-filter scan.
