"""Shared voice layer: the single boundary between RAW stored voice data
(``User.voice_examples`` / the ``OPERATOR_VOICE_EXAMPLES`` env fallback) and the
MODEL-READY voice context both drafting surfaces inject into their prompts.

Two surfaces speak in the host's voice and must not drift apart:
  - the cold-DM composer (``agents/outreach.py``, Claude Haiku)
  - the follow-up relationship agent (``agents/relationship_agent.py``, Sonnet)

Historically each surface copy-pasted the same JSON-parse + ``[:8]`` cap + env
fallback, and rendered its own ``<style_examples>`` block. This module owns that
mechanism so the two stay consistent and later voice work is written once.

Scope discipline (see the staged voice plan):
  - Step 0 (this module, today) is BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING: it centralizes the parse
    logic and the follow-up agent's existing block format. It does NOT change any
    rendered string, does NOT touch the em-dash scrubbers (the two surfaces use
    intentionally different ones), and does NOT alter the cold-DM block wording.
  - Step 2 adds a structured ``host_voice_profile`` (``profile`` is ``None`` here).
  - Step 4 wires channel/message_type-scoped retrieval. Stored voice examples may
    now carry provenance (``{"text", "channel", "message_type"}``) alongside the
    legacy plain-string form; :func:`build_voice_context` filters to the examples
    that match the requested ``channel``/``message_type``. Untagged examples stay
    channel-agnostic, so existing plain-string data behaves exactly as before.
