"""
agents/sponsor_matcher.py : sponsor↔attendee scoring.

Stage 04 extension. A sponsor brings a buyer_profile (target_role,
seniority, company_stage, industry, intent="buying") that we score
against every attending Prospect's OFFERS/SEEKS vector using the SAME
pairwise machinery the guest↔guest matcher uses:

  - When ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set, we ride on matcher_lib by feeding the
    buyer_profile in as one more Person in the same compute_matrix call
    that already ran for guests. This keeps the rubric, the enrichment,
    and the composite scoring identical : sponsor scoring is "one more
    row in the matrix", not a parallel pipeline.

  - Otherwise we fall back to the same kind of rule-based scoring
    matcher.build_edges does for guest pairs : role overlap, seniority
    alignment, stage match, industry/works_on adjacency. Result carries
    reasons[] so the WHY? popover can render the same way.

Idempotent: callers (routes/matching.py) wipe sponsor_matches for the
event before recomputing, just like MatchEdge.
