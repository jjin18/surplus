"""
agents/scorer.py : stage 03a, fit scoring.

Two pieces:
  score_prospect(p, event) -> (score, reason)
      Deterministic 0-100 fit score with a human-readable rationale. Built from
      source signal strength + ICP match. Deterministic on purpose: the same
      inputs must always produce the same score so the threshold is stable and
      the result is auditable.

  floating_threshold(scores, funnel_target) -> int
      Fit is not a binary. The accept line *floats*: it drops only as far as it
      must to clear the funnel target, and never below ABS_FLOOR. Tight pool ->
      high bar; thin pool -> the bar gives, but only to the floor.

Accepts the Prospect ORM object directly (or any object with the same
attributes : tests pass a SimpleNamespace).
