"""
agents/prospector.py : stage 02, concurrent fan-out + ICP gate.

`prospect()` calls every source adapter at once with asyncio.gather, then
merges their partial records on `identity`. The result is a list of plain
dicts : one per unique person : carrying whatever fields the sources between
them could resolve.

When ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set, every merged candidate then passes through
`llm.judge_relevance()`. The LLM gatekeeper sees the full merged profile
+ the ICP and emits a binary verdict. Non-relevant candidates are dropped
before they ever hit the database, so downstream stages (scorer, outreach,
matcher) only ever see ICP-aligned people.

In mock mode (no API key) the relevance gate is skipped : the mock pool is
already hand-curated, so re-filtering would just churn the demo.
