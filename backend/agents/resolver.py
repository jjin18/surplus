"""
agents/resolver.py : one place that turns any of three in-person inputs into a
resolved LinkedIn identity.

Three entry points, from highest to lowest confidence:

  normalize_linkedin_url(text) -> str | None
      Canonicalize a QR-decoded string OR a pasted URL to
      https://www.linkedin.com/in/<handle>, stripping tracking params.

  resolve_by_url(linkedin_url, provider) -> dict
      HIGH confidence. The operator scanned a QR or pasted a real profile URL,
      so we trust the handle and resolve it to the provider's internal id.

  resolve_by_text(name, title, company) -> list[dict]
      LOW confidence. Only a typed name/title/company : returns RANKED
      candidates for the operator to pick from. Never auto-picks.

Reuse over new code:
  - provider.resolve_linkedin_user (providers/unipile.py) for the URL -> id hop,
    which already respects dry-run (returns a deterministic fake id, no HTTP).
  - exa.fetch_url_snippet / exa.resolve_person / exa._api_key for the Exa path,
    all gated by EXA_API_KEY : no key means no Exa call.

REAL LinkedIn "My Code" QR payload
----------------------------------
The app's Search bar -> QR icon -> "My code" tab encodes a STANDARD profile URL
with share-tracking query params appended, e.g. (iOS):

    https://www.linkedin.com/in/maya-rodriguez?utm_source=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=member_ios

(Android swaps the last value for member_android; clean copies have no params at
all; country accounts can use a subdomain like uk.linkedin.com.) We do NOT
special-case the utm_* names : normalize_linkedin_url drops the ENTIRE query +
fragment, so it's robust to whatever tracking params LinkedIn changes them to,
and only trusts inputs we can pin to a linkedin.com host with an /in/<handle>
path.
