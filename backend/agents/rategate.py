"""agents/rategate.py : one priority gate in front of every relationship-layer
Claude call.

The relationship layer is a pile of fan-outs ("do an AI thing for each of N
people" : score health, detect updates, draft, classify). They all draw on one
Anthropic key with a fixed per-minute budget, so any "across my whole book"
action can burst past the limit -> 429 -> backoff -> user-visible stall.

This gate makes that rare and controlled instead of random:

  * a TOTAL in-flight cap (CLAUDE_MAX_CONCURRENCY) so we self-throttle BELOW the
    key's real concurrency instead of letting the SDK discover the limit via 429s,
  * a smaller BACKGROUND sub-cap (CLAUDE_BG_CONCURRENCY), and
  * soft priority: a background call won't grab a slot while a FOREGROUND call is
    queued for one. User clicks win the race; sweeps wait behind them.

It does NOT replace the SDK's own retry; it shrinks how often that retry is
needed and keeps the pain off the user's request. Anything that calls Claude
without going through here can still burst -- so route relationship-layer calls
through gate().

Usage:
    with gate(background=False):      # foreground: /ask, clicked draft
        resp = client.messages.create(...)
    with gate(background=True):       # background: updates sweep, bulk scoring
        ...
