"""agents/live_enrich.py : ground outreach in REAL LinkedIn data.

Two pulls, both best-effort and cached so we never re-hit Unipile for the
same target:

  1. Per-prospect : their live LinkedIn profile + recent posts. Makes the
     connection note reference something true and current about THEM instead
     of ICP-derived guesses (seeks/offers). Cached via Prospect.enriched_at.

  2. Per-host : a sample of the host's own recent sent messages, used as
     voice examples so composed outreach sounds like the host. Cached via
     User.voice_synced_at. Never overwrites manually-curated voice_examples.

Both are gated on a LIVE (non-dry-run) provider with an account_id : you
can't read live LinkedIn without a real connected account. In dry-run /
demo, enrichment is skipped and compose falls back to discovery-time (Exa)
data + configured voice examples — so a demo never shows "[dry-run]" text.
