"""
agents/roi.py : stage 05, verified settlement.

ROI settles against the goal set at intake. For each confirmed guest it derives
a conversion tier from verified fit, maps that to the goal's outcome
(won / partial / lost) and dollar value, and rolls the whole thing up into the
ledger + aggregate metrics.

settle() -> (ledger, metrics)
  ledger  : one row per guest : the deliverable. "Who actually converted."
  metrics : net ROI %, value generated vs budget, the invited->converted funnel.

NOTE : open design question: tier_of() maps fit score straight to outcome
tier. That is a *prediction*, not verification. The trustworthy version reads
real 30/60/90-day follow-up data per guest; this is the placeholder that lets
the rest of the pipeline run end to end.
