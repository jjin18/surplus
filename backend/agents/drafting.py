"""agents/drafting.py : the ONE follow-up-message composer, shared by every
surface (BookApp's /draft tap, the relationship chat, future surfaces).

Why this exists
---------------
We had two drafters: the rich one inside relationship_agent.py (voice-matched,
continues the real message thread, strips em dashes) and a stripped-down one in
book.py (name + a `next_step` string, no voice, em dashes leaking through). The
surface users actually see ("Your book today") ran the dumb one. This module is
the consolidation: a single composer that pulls the host's voice and the real
prior-message thread, so a follow-up reads like the same person continuing the
same conversation, on whichever surface drafts it.

It reuses the relationship agent's building blocks (voice examples, the
timeline->thread distiller, the dash scrub) so there is one source of truth for
"how a follow-up is written," and book.py's generic Claude-JSON caller so all
LLM calls share the same client + [book] tracing.

#   build_context(db, ...)  -- all DB reads, on the request thread
#   compose_from_context()  -- pure LLM call, safe to run concurrently
# compose_followup() chains both for the single-draft (/draft tap) caller.
