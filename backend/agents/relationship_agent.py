"""
agents/relationship_agent.py : the first genuinely agentic surface.

Where reply_agent / outreach are single-shot ("here's a thread, write a
reply"), this is a *loop* : the model surveys your relationship spine, picks
who needs attention, pulls each person's history, and proposes a concrete
next move — looping tool-by-tool until it's worked the list or hits the step
cap. It runs on agent_loop.run_agent (the bounded tool-use primitive).

SAFETY — propose-only by construction:
  The agent has NO tool that sends a message or writes to the database. Its
  "act" tools (`propose_next_step`, `draft_message`) only stage suggestions
  into an in-memory bag that we hand back to the caller. Nothing leaves the
  process without a human approving it downstream. This mirrors the
  reply_agent split (the model never holds the trigger) and means the worst
  case of a hallucinating loop is a bad *suggestion*, never a bad send.

  Graduating to "act with guardrails" later is purely additive : swap a
  propose tool's impl to call add_note / send_and_log behind a policy gate.
  The loop, the prompt, and the read tools don't change.

The read tools wrap the deterministic contact spine (relationships.py), so
the agent reasons over the SAME auditable facts the CRM page shows : it can't
invent contacts, stages, or timelines.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are a relationship manager for an event host. You work their durable "
    "contact spine — the people they've met across events — and keep those "
    "relationships from going cold.\n\n"
    "Your loop each run:\n"
    "1. The host's FULL contact roster is given to you inline (one row per "
    "person, with the same signals a survey would return). You already have it "
    "— do NOT waste a turn fetching it; read the roster directly.\n"
    "2. Decide WHO to follow up with from these signals (NOT from fresh "
    "external news), in this PRIORITY ORDER:\n"
    "   a. MARKED follow-ups — AUTHORITATIVE: `marked_follow_up` true (the host "
    "tagged them 'follow_up') OR a `next_step` the host wrote down. The host has "
    "EXPLICITLY decided to follow up with these people, so they are ALWAYS worth "
    "actioning this run. CRITICAL: an initial outreach that hasn't been answered "
    "yet is the REASON to follow up, never a reason to wait. Do NOT skip a marked "
    "contact just because their first message is recent or still unanswered — "
    "that recency/no-reply logic does NOT apply to marked contacts. Suppress a "
    "marked contact ONLY if the host has already acted AGAIN: `prior_messages` "
    "shows a SECOND host message after the first (a real follow-up already went "
    "out) OR the contact has REPLIED (an inbound 'them' message). Absent those, "
    "draft the follow-up.\n"
    "   b. Conversation context: after `get_contact`, read `prior_messages`. An "
    "unanswered question or open loop from THEM (the last message is theirs and "
    "expects a reply) is a high-priority candidate; a thread the host left "
    "mid-conversation is a candidate too.\n"
    "   c. Stale, UNMARKED: a live relationship gone quiet past the stale line "
    "is a candidate. BUT for an unmarked contact whose ONLY touch is a recent, "
    "un-replied first outreach, hold off — a second message this soon would be "
    "piling on. Note them as 'revisit if it goes stale' rather than drafting now. "
    "This hold-off applies ONLY to unmarked contacts; it never overrides (a).\n"
    "3. For each candidate, call `get_contact` to read their full "
    "history (events shared, stage, timeline) BEFORE deciding anything. Never "
    "propose a move without reading the history first. Pay special attention to "
    "`prior_messages` — the actual thread between the host and this person. The "
    "FIRST item there is the initial message/context (the first DM or the note "
    "from when they met); a follow-up must read as a continuation of THAT "
    "conversation, not a fresh cold open.\n"
    "4. Propose ONE concrete move per person you act on: either "
    "`propose_next_step` (a specific action the host should take) and/or "
    "`draft_message` (a short, warm, specific message). The draft MUST build on "
    "`prior_messages`: pick up the thread where it left off, reference what was "
    "already said or the initial context, and only then add the new reason to "
    "reach out (a job change, a post, time passing). Never generic, never a "
    "restart that ignores the first message. Quality over quantity.\n"
    "   WORK ONE PERSON AT A TIME: read a candidate with `get_contact`, then "
    "immediately propose their move before moving to the next person. Do NOT "
    "batch-read everyone first — the host watches each proposal appear live, so "
    "interleaving read->propose gets the first one in front of them fastest.\n"
    "5. When you've worked the priority list, stop and give a SHORT, "
    "conversational closing line, like you're texting the host back. ONE or two "
    "sentences, plain prose. NEVER use markdown tables, headers (#), or bullet "
    "lists — the per-person detail already rides along in each draft's "
    "`rationale`, so the summary is just a friendly wrap-up (e.g. \"Drafted "
    "first-touches for all 5, Shama's the one I'd prioritize.\"). Do not "
    "re-list everyone you already drafted.\n\n"
    "Rules: Only use facts returned by the tools — never invent an event, a "
    "name, or a detail. You CANNOT send anything; you only propose. Keep "
    "drafts under ~60 words and human, not salesy. NEVER use em dashes (—) or "
    "en dashes (–) in a draft — they read as AI-written; use a comma, a period, "
    "or restructure the sentence instead. If a <style_examples> block is "
    "provided below, every draft MUST be written in the host's voice as shown "
    "there (their greeting, sign-off, sentence length, formality, punctuation "
    "and emoji habits) — match the voice, not the content. This is the SAME "
    "voice the host's first message was written in; a follow-up must sound like "

# ───────────────────────── concurrent variant ──────────────────────────────
#
# The sequential loop above pays for latency that scales with the number of
# people it works: each person is a fresh, SERIAL Claude turn (read -> draft),
# so time-to-all-cards is ~Σ(per-person draft). The drafts don't depend on each
# other, though, so we can split the run into two phases and parallelise the
# expensive one:
#
#   Phase 1 — TRIAGE  (one Sonnet call): the roster goes in, a ranked list of
#     who-to-follow-up-with + why comes out. Roster-signal only; no per-person
#     history yet. This is the single short "silent" window (covered by the
#     stream heartbeat).
#   Phase 1.5 — MATERIALISE CONTEXT (sequential, in the worker thread): pull
#     each selected person's history via the DB. Done BEFORE fan-out and on ONE
#     thread because a SQLAlchemy Session is not thread-safe — the parallel jobs
#     must never touch `db`.
#   Phase 2 — DRAFT  (parallel): one Sonnet call PER person, fanned out under a
#     bounded asyncio.Semaphore (same proven pattern as
#     outreach.prefetch_compose_all) so they run concurrently instead of
#     end-to-end. Each draft stages its card the instant it resolves, so the
#     host sees follow-ups stream in as they finish. Time-to-all-cards collapses
#     from ~Σ(draft) to ~max(draft).
#
# Safety is unchanged: the only "act" tools are propose_next_step / draft_message
# (staged, never sent). The draft phase ALSO gets `skip_contact`, the escape
# hatch that restores the loop's suppression rule (don't pile on if a follow-up
# already went out or they already replied) now that the full thread is in hand.

# Keep Sonnet for both phases — quality + voice matching depend on it. Same env
# override the loop honours, falling back to agent_loop's Sonnet default.

# Bounded fan-out width. The real ceiling is Anthropic's per-key rate limit, not

# keeps a 100-contact host from firing a dozen simultaneous Sonnet calls into a
