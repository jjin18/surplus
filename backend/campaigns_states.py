"""campaigns_states.py : the worklist — every priority state, what it publishes,
and how far its adapter has got.

WHY THIS IS CODE AND NOT A MARKDOWN TABLE. A list of states in a document goes
stale the moment an adapter lands and nobody edits the doc; this one reads the
live registry, so "written" and "configured" are observed rather than claimed.
`status()` is the answer to "where are we", and it cannot lie about which
adapters exist because it asks campaigns_sources rather than a hand-kept field.

WHAT A PROFILE IS FOR. Before writing a state's adapter you want to know three
things: what shape it publishes (a PDF needs a parser, a Socrata portal needs
an id), whether anyone has confirmed that, and which of its office names will
break the shared normaliser. The first two order the work. The third is the one
that silently corrupts data if missed -- Pennsylvania's "Representative in the
General Assembly" filed every statehouse candidate as a U.S. House candidate
until it was mapped -- so `office_trap` records it per state, in advance,
whether or not the adapter exists yet.

CONFIDENCE IS RECORDED, NOT ASSUMED. `publication` says how well the format is
actually known:

    confirmed  a specific document or portal was identified
    likely     the state is known to run a platform that probably carries it
    assumed    a shape was ASSUMED so the generic adapter could be wired.
               Nobody has checked. The adapter will refuse to run until
               someone sets a dataset, so an assumption cannot quietly become
               a fetch -- but it is recorded as an assumption, not a finding.
    unknown    nobody has looked, and no shape is claimed

The distinction between "assumed" and "confirmed" is the one that matters when
someone picks up a state: writing "file" for a state nobody has opened would
make the worklist look finished and send them down the wrong path, so the
level says plainly which it is. A test enforces that "unknown" never carries
a shape.

None of this fetches anything. It is a map of the territory, kept beside the
code that crosses it.
