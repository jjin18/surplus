<h1>surplus Chrome Extension — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="upd">Last updated: June 28, 2026</p>
<p>The surplus Chrome extension ("the extension") lets you view your surplus
relationship book alongside your browser and capture LinkedIn profiles into your
surplus account. This policy explains what data the extension handles.</p>
<h2>What the extension accesses</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>LinkedIn profile information.</b> When you are viewing a LinkedIn profile
page (<code>linkedin.com/in/...</code>), the extension reads the publicly
displayed name, headline, and profile URL so it can show you who you are viewing
and, if you choose, capture them into surplus.</li>
<li><b>Your surplus session.</b> The extension loads your surplus book
(<code>event.surpluslayer.com</code>) in a side panel using the session cookie
already set when you signed in to surplus. The extension never sees or stores
your password.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What the extension sends, and when</h2>
<ul>
<li>A LinkedIn profile is sent to surplus <b>only when you click "Capture to
surplus."</b> At that point the name, headline, and URL are sent to your own
surplus account to create a contact and draft a message.</li>
<li>The extension does <b>not</b> continuously upload or track your browsing, and
does <b>not</b> send data to any third party other than your surplus account.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>The extension keeps only the most recently viewed profile in memory to
populate the panel. Captured contacts live in your surplus account, governed by
the surplus privacy policy.</p>
<h2>Data sharing and sale</h2>
<p>We do <b>not</b> sell your data or share it with advertisers or third parties.
Captured data goes only to your surplus account.</p>
<h2>Permissions, and why</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>linkedin.com</b> — read the profile you are viewing.</li>
<li><b>event.surpluslayer.com</b> — display your book and capture profiles.</li>
<li><b>side panel, tabs, scripting, storage</b> — show the panel, detect the
active LinkedIn page, and inject the profile reader.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contact</h2>

<h1>surplus — Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="upd">Last updated: July 1, 2026</p>
<p>surplus (surpluslayer.com) helps you keep up with your professional
relationships: it organizes the people you know, drafts outreach for you, and
keeps your follow-ups on track. This policy explains what data surplus handles
and how.</p>
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Account information.</b> Your name, email address, and sign-in
credentials (via Google, Microsoft, or an email + password you set).</li>
<li><b>Contacts and relationships.</b> People you capture or import — names,
titles, companies, LinkedIn profile URLs, email addresses, and notes you add.</li>
<li><b>Connected services.</b> When you connect an account (Google, Microsoft,
LinkedIn via Unipile, Calendly, and similar), surplus accesses the data needed
for the features you use — for example calendar events to schedule and record
meetings, and your contacts to build your relationship book.</li>
<li><b>Messages.</b> Drafts surplus writes for you and conversations you sync,
so drafting can be grounded in your real relationship history.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we use Google user data</h2>
<p>If you sign in with Google or connect a Google account, surplus requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Basic profile (openid, email, profile)</b> — to create and identify
your account.</li>
<li><b>Calendar events (calendar.events)</b> — to schedule meetings you ask
surplus to book and to reflect meetings in your relationship timeline.</li>
<li><b>Contacts, read-only (contacts.readonly)</b> — to import your address
book into your relationship book so surplus can help you keep up with those
people.</li>
</ul>
<p>surplus's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google
API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
Google user data is used only to provide the user-facing features described
above; it is never sold, never used for advertising, and never transferred to
third parties except as required to provide these features or comply with law.
We do not use Google user data to train generalized AI or machine-learning
models.</p>
<h2>How we use your data generally</h2>
<ul>
<li>To provide surplus's features: your relationship book, drafted messages,
reminders, and scheduling.</li>
<li>We do <b>not</b> sell your data. We do <b>not</b> share it with advertisers.</li>
<li>Service providers that process data on our behalf (hosting, email
delivery, the Unipile messaging API, AI drafting providers) are used only to
operate surplus.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Storage, retention, and deletion</h2>
<p>Your data is stored on our hosting provider's infrastructure and retained
while your account is active. You can disconnect any connected service at any
time from Settings, which stops further syncing. To delete your account and
its data, contact us at the address below and we will remove it.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Data is transmitted over HTTPS and stored with access controls. OAuth
tokens are stored server-side and never exposed to other users.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>surplus is a relationship manager for people whose work runs on
relationships. It organizes everyone you know into a living "book," keeps
track of who needs attention, drafts your outreach and follow-ups for you,
and helps you schedule time with the people who matter — so no relationship
goes cold by accident.</p>

<h2>What surplus does</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Your book.</b> The people you meet — captured from LinkedIn, imported
from your contacts, or added by hand — organized with their context: who they
are, how you met, and where the relationship stands.</li>
<li><b>Drafted outreach.</b> surplus writes personalized connection notes and
follow-up messages grounded in your real history with each person; you review
and send.</li>
<li><b>Follow-ups on autopilot.</b> A daily view of who needs attention, with
reminders and scheduling so you keep momentum without keeping lists.</li>
</ul>

<div class="card">
<h2 style="margin-top:0">How surplus uses your Google data</h2>
<p>If you sign in with Google, surplus asks only for your basic profile
(name and email) to create your account. Separately — and only when you choose
to connect them — surplus requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Google Calendar (calendar.events):</b> to book the meetings you ask
surplus to schedule and reflect them in your relationship timeline.</li>
<li><b>Google Contacts (read-only):</b> to import your address book into your
book so surplus can help you keep up with those people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your data is used only to provide these features — never sold, never used
for advertising. Full details in the
<a href="https://event.surpluslayer.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Get started</h2>
<p>Open the app at <a href="https://event.surpluslayer.com">event.surpluslayer.com</a>

<h1>Trust &amp; Security</h1>
<p class="upd">Last updated: July 5, 2026</p>

<p>This page describes how surplus protects your data and, just as importantly,
where the real boundaries are. We would rather be precise than impressive.</p>

<h2>Encryption in transit</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All traffic to surplus is served over <strong>TLS 1.3 (fallback 1.2)</strong>, with HSTS.</li>
  <li>Connections to our database and to every third-party service we call are encrypted in transit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Encryption at rest</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Databases, disks, and backups are <strong>encrypted at rest</strong> by our infrastructure provider.</li>
  <li>The most sensitive fields (e.g. connected-account credentials) are additionally encrypted at the <strong>application layer</strong> before they are written, using <strong>per-tenant keys</strong> so one firm's data cannot be decrypted with another firm's key.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tenant isolation</h2>
<p>Each firm's data is isolated. Context assembled for AI features is built only
from your own records — one firm's data can never enter another firm's request.</p>

<h2>AI processing — the honest boundary</h2>
<div class="box">
<p><strong>surplus is not end-to-end encrypted for AI-processed content.</strong>
To draft messages and answer questions, our servers must decrypt the relevant
content and send it, over TLS, to our AI provider. It is briefly in plaintext
in memory during processing.</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>We <strong>minimize</strong> what we send: identifiers like emails, phone numbers, and card/SSN patterns are stripped from content before it reaches the model — we send only what the task needs.</li>
  <li>Our AI provider processes requests under a commercial agreement; your content is not used to train models.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data retention &amp; deletion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can <strong>export</strong> all of your data at any time.</li>
  <li>You can <strong>delete</strong> your account and all associated data; deletion also revokes connected third-party access. We keep a metadata-only record that a deletion occurred (never its contents).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Subprocessors</h2>
<p>We share data with the following providers only as needed to run the service:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> — AI model (drafting, Q&amp;A)</li>
  <li><strong>Unipile</strong> — LinkedIn / WhatsApp / email connectivity</li>
  <li><strong>Bright Data</strong> — public-profile enrichment</li>
  <li><strong>Exa</strong> — web search</li>
  <li><strong>Resend</strong> — transactional email</li>
  <li><strong>Stripe</strong> — billing</li>
  <li><strong>Google / Microsoft</strong> — sign-in, mail &amp; calendar (when you connect them)</li>
  <li><strong>Zoom</strong> — meeting links (when connected)</li>
  <li><strong>Railway</strong> — hosting &amp; database &nbsp;•&nbsp; <strong>Cloudflare</strong> — edge / TLS &nbsp;•&nbsp; <strong>Modal</strong> — batch jobs</li>
</ul>
