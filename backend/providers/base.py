"""
providers/base.py : the LinkedInProvider contract.

Every provider (Unipile, future Manual, future others) implements this
interface. The rest of the app only ever sees the canonical types defined
here:

    LeadPayload      : what we hand to the provider (already personalized)
    ProviderResult   : what the provider hands back (dry-run or real)
    CanonicalEvent   : normalized webhook event ready to apply to OutreachLog
    CANONICAL_STATES : the only state strings the rest of the app deals with

Providers translate between their own dialect and these canonical shapes
inside their own module. Outside the providers/ package, no provider-specific
strings should ever appear.

# ── Outbound copy hygiene ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Em/en/figure dashes are a giveaway that copy was machine-written and read
# stiff in a LinkedIn note. We replace them with a comma so every message
# that leaves the box reads human. Applied in LeadPayload.__post_init__ so
# EVERY send path (invite note, post-accept DM, follow-up, AI auto-reply)
# is covered : they all build a LeadPayload before hitting a provider.
#
# Two cases collapse to a comma:
#   1. Real em/en/figure dashes (and the unicode minus), tight or spaced.
#   2. An ASCII hyphen-minus used AS a dash, i.e. surrounded by whitespace
#      ("Vancouver - let's ..."). A *spaced* hyphen is the same machine-copy
#      tell as an em dash. A hyphen WITHOUT surrounding spaces ("co-founder")
#      is a real hyphenated word and is deliberately left untouched.

# note. The compose prompt forbids it, but a prompt rule can't be trusted
