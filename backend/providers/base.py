providers/base.py : the LinkedInProvider contract.

Every provider (Unipile, future Manual, future others) implements this
interface. The rest of the app only ever sees the canonical types defined
here:

    LeadPayload      : what we hand to the provider (already personalized)
    ProviderResult   : what the provider hands back (dry-run or real)
    CanonicalEvent   : normalized webhook event ready to apply to OutreachLog
    CANONICAL_STATES : the only state strings the rest of the app deals with

Providers translate between their own dialect and these canonical shapes
inside their own module. Outside the providers/ package, no provider-specific
strings should ever appear.
