db.py : DB engine + session.

In production, reads DATABASE_URL (Railway provides a Postgres URL when a
Postgres service is attached). In local dev or when DATABASE_URL is unset,
falls back to a SQLite file at backend/data/surplus.db.

Why this matters: Railway's container filesystem is ephemeral by default :
every deploy gets a fresh disk, so the SQLite DB (and every Session/User
row in it) is wiped on each redeploy. Postgres survives deploys, so user
sessions don't get invalidated every time we push.

    Why this exists:
      Before multi-tenant, every Event was anonymous and every send used
      UNIPILE_ACCOUNT_ID from env. After the migration, every Event needs an
      owner (a User row). The cleanest backfill is to invent a "operator" User
      whose unipile_account_id matches the env var, then reassign every
      orphaned event to that operator. This way:
        - Existing events stay reachable (visible to operator, sends still
          go through the env-var account)
        - New events created by signed-in users belong to those users
        - The webhook handler has a deterministic fallback when an event's
          user is the operator (it just uses the env-var provider)

    Idempotent : safe to run on every startup. No-op when:
      - UNIPILE_ACCOUNT_ID env var is unset (e.g. fresh dev machine)
      - The operator User already exists (subsequent startups)
