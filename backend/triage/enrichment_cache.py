"""triage/enrichment_cache.py : cross-event, identity-keyed enrichment cache.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every live LinkedIn (Unipile) profile read is a real account action against a
tiny pool of team accounts — the binding constraint behind the "stripped-200"
soft-throttle. ``Applicant.enrichment_raw`` already freezes evidence so a re-run
of ONE event is free, but it is keyed on the applicant *row*: the same person
applying to another event is a new row and gets re-fetched, re-burning an action.

This module caches the frozen ``RawEvidence`` by *resolved identity*, shared
across events, so a person enriched once is reused everywhere. It is the first
concrete layer of the migration documented in ``enrichment_provider.py`` (the
read-through cache). It does NOT change the evidence shape — downstream
reconcile/score/consolidate are untouched.

DESIGN
  - STRONG KEYS ONLY. A write/read key is a LinkedIn slug ("li:<slug>") or a
    salted email hash ("em:<sha256>"). Never a name — a name-only key collides
    across people (the Brittany/Kyndred class of bug). ``identity_keys`` returns
    every strong key derivable from the inputs; the same profile is written under
    each, so a future event that knows EITHER the email OR the LinkedIn URL hits.
  - EMAIL-FIRST IS THE POINT. The email hash is free on every Luma row; the slug
    costs a people-search to obtain. So an email hit avoids the search action too,
    not just the profile fetch.
  - OWN SESSION. evaluate_all holds one Session on the event-loop thread and
    commits once at the end. The cache is independent of that transaction (a
    cached profile is valid regardless of whether the event's evaluation
    commits), so cache_get/cache_put open their OWN short-lived SessionLocal and
    commit independently. Callers invoke them via asyncio.to_thread so the shared
    session stays single-threaded and DB I/O never blocks the loop.
  - FAIL-SOFT. Any DB/JSON error degrades to a cache miss (cache_get -> None) or a
    silent skip (cache_put), never an exception. A broken cache must never sink a
    triage run — same contract as enrichment never raising.
  - QUALITY GUARD. We never cache an empty pull or a throttle-stripped one
    (work_unreliable) — that mirrors the enrichment_raw freeze guard, so a gutted
    profile can't ossify across events.
  - FLAG-GATED. Off unless TRIAGE_ENRICH_CACHE is truthy. When off, every helper
    is a no-op and behavior is exactly today's.
