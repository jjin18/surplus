routes/relationships.py : read API for the event-native relationship layer.

Surfaces the schema-free timeline + summary built by agents/relationships.py.
Every route is owner-scoped : a prospect is only reachable by the user who owns
its event (same 404-on-not-owned discipline as get_owned_event), so relationship
data never leaks across users.
