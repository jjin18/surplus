"""
routes/demo.py — hidden-link demo entry point.

Goal: hand someone (an investor, a friend, a candidate user) a single URL
that drops them into the full surplus app without making them sign in
with their own LinkedIn first. They get a real signed-in session backed
by the operator user (i.e., the LinkedIn account configured via the
UNIPILE_ACCOUNT_ID env var), so every action — including real outreach
sends — works end-to-end.

Security model:
  - Gated by a shared secret in the DEMO_ACCESS_TOKEN env var.
  - URL is NOT meant to be public. Don't post it on Twitter. The trade-off
    for "everything works including real sends" is that anyone with the
    link can spend the operator's daily LinkedIn quota and send DMs from
    your account.
  - When DEMO_ACCESS_TOKEN is unset, the route returns 404 — it doesn't
    exist in production unless you opt in by setting the env var.
  - constant-time comparison on the token to avoid timing attacks.

Share URL shape:
  https://www.surpluslayer.com/api/demo/enter?key=<DEMO_ACCESS_TOKEN>

Effect:
  - 303 redirect to "/" with the surplus_session cookie set
  - Session is tied to the operator User row (same one auto-created by
    _ensure_operator_user_and_backfill at startup)
  - From that point the SPA behaves identically to a real signed-in user

To revoke a leaked link: rotate DEMO_ACCESS_TOKEN in Railway env. Active
sessions issued by the old link continue to work until their 30-day TTL
expires (they're indistinguishable from a normal session) — to kill them
immediately, delete the corresponding rows from the sessions table.
