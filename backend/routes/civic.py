"""
routes/civic.py : Civic policy search.

    POST /api/civic/ask          question (+ place or dropped pin) -> Answer
    GET  /api/civic/answer/{id}  the cached answer behind a permalink
    GET  /civic                  the map + ladder page
    GET  /civic/r/{id}           the same page, opened on a shared answer

No DB, no auth, no accounts : an answer is a pure function of the question and
the place, cached for 24h by sha256(question|location). The Anthropic key
lives only here, server-side -- the browser never sees it, which is the whole
reason this route exists instead of the prototype's direct fetch to the API.

Civic is a bolt-on, not part of the product, so it is fenced off from the rest
of surplus rather than trusted to behave:

  * It shares the process with the CRM. A synthesis call blocks a threadpool
    thread for 15-25s, and the pool (~40 threads, WEB_CONCURRENCY=1 by
    default) is the same one every sync CRM route runs on. `_SLOTS` caps how
    many of those threads Civic may ever hold ; past the cap it sheds load
    with a 503 instead of queueing behind them.
  * It shares ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and EXA_API_KEY with drafting and prospecting,
    so a busy day here is spend and rate-limit pressure there. `_DAILY_CAP`
    bounds the number of answers it will synthesize per day.
  * CIVIC_ENABLED=0 turns the whole surface off -- page included -- without a
    deploy, if it ever does become someone else's problem.
  * It touches no database, no session, no user. The only thing it imports
    from the app is the per-IP rate limiter, and tests pin that.

The synthesis itself (prompt, evidence ladder, URL grounding) lives in
backend/civic.py; this module is the HTTP skin and the fence around it.
