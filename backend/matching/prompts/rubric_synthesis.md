# Match rubric synthesis prompt

You design a person-to-person matching rubric for ONE specific event. Given the event's name, description, and a summary of the guest list, you produce a JSON rubric that a deterministic scorer will apply to every pair of attendees.

The rubric must be **event-aware**: a hackathon needs teammate matching (skill complementarity), a fellowship reunion needs cofounder/mentor matching, a salon needs conversational compatibility. You decide what "good match" means for THIS event.

## Input

```
EVENT NAME:        {event_name}
EVENT DESCRIPTION: {event_description}

GUEST LIST SUMMARY:
  Total approved attendees:  {total_count}
  Ticket types present:      {ticket_type_counts}
  Top role keywords:         {top_roles}
  Top company keywords:      {top_companies}
  Experience levels:         {exp_level_counts}
```

## Your task

1. Infer the **event type**: hackathon, fellowship cohort, founder summit, salon, mixer, conference, dinner, meetup, etc.
2. Decide the **match intent**: what does "good match" mean here? (teammate / cofounder / intro / mentor / deal_flow / conversation / hire / mixed)
3. Produce a **role_pair_matrix** that scores every observed ticket_type × ticket_type pair from 0.0 to 1.0. Use the actual ticket_type values from the guest list (not generic ones). Symmetric.
4. Decide **hard gates** : dimensions that must clear a threshold or the pair scores 0.
5. Choose **weights** on the two axes (similar and complementary). User has expressed: more weight on complementary, less on similar. Tune for this event.
6. Pick **anti-signals** with their penalty multipliers.

## Design rules

- **`role_pair_matrix` keys must use the actual ticket_type values from the input** (e.g. "Attendee", "Spectator", "Judge"). Generic placeholders like "Founder" are wrong unless that literal value appears in the guest list. Always include both orderings or document that it's symmetric.
- **Sum of weights inside each block must equal 1.0** (`axis_blend`, `similar`, `complementary`).
- **`axis_blend.complementary` should be higher** than `axis_blend.similar` by default (user preference: ~70/30), but you may adjust ±10pp if the event strongly favors one (e.g. a private peer dinner needs more similar; a cofounder mixer needs even more complementary).
- **hard_gates** : `min_similar_score` should be **0.03–0.10** (very permissive). Real-world data is sparse: most pairs share at most one or two domain tags. A gate above 0.10 kills almost all cross-role matches. Use 0.10 only for narrow single-topic events; default to 0.05. `min_role_pair_score` of 0.20–0.30 is the bigger filter : it cuts out genuinely incompatible role pairs (e.g. Volunteer↔Volunteer).
- **anti_signals** : multipliers in (0.0, 1.0). Lower number = harsher penalty. Direct competitor is the most punishing.
- **No fabrication.** Don't invent ticket types or roles not present in the input. If a ticket type is unknown how to weight, default its row to 0.5.

## Anchoring examples

- **Hackathon (Attendees + Judges + Investors + Spectators)**:
  - match_intent: `hackathon_teammate`
  - High weight on `skill_complement` + `experience_asymmetry`; high on `domain_overlap` (same hackathon track)
  - Attendee|Attendee = 1.0 (teammate); Attendee|Judge = 0.8 (mentor); Attendee|Investor = 0.5 (limited; investors come for deal flow, not teaming)

- **Fellowship reunion (everyone "Fellow" or "Alumni")**:
  - match_intent: `mixed` or `cofounder`
  - High weight on `conviction_overlap` (shared worldview) + `skill_complement` (cofounder potential)
  - Lower weight on `role_complement` (everyone is a founder/builder)

- **Founder summit (Founders + Investors + Speakers)**:
  - match_intent: `deal_flow`
  - Founder|Investor = 1.0; Founder|Founder = 0.8; Investor|Investor = 0.4
